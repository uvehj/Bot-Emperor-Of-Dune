#The three files:

1-Single sends a single Tweet
2-Daemon waits, sends tweet - repeat
3-Testing creates and prints a test tweet, does not send anything

#Running them

All python files require a valid txt file to run (in the same directory).
The time to sleep and the twitter keys are hardcoded, so they must be modified by hand (Testing can be done without this).

#Creating a suitable TXT file

All sentences must be finished with a new line, not a period ("."). Ending them with periods will lead to double periods
The sentences can both contain ",", "?" and "!" with a space before them or just righ after a word, the results vary slightly and the best solution is subjective.
